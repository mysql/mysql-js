/**
 * ConnectionProperties()
 * IMMEDIATE
 * CONSTRUCTOR
 * 
 * ConnectionProperties provides a powerful and flexible means to obtain the
 * particular set of ConnectionProperties for an instance of an application.
 * Its two parameters identify a backend database (e.g. "mysql", "ndb", etc.)
 * and a connection environment (e.g. "test", "staging", "readonly", etc.).
 *
 * implName_or_connectionProperties may either be the name of a Jones
 * adapter (e.g. "mysql"), or a ConnectionProperties object.
 *   - If it is a string naming a backend adapter, then the default
 *     ConnectionProperties for that adapter will be fetched.
 *   - If it is an object, the object must contain a member property
 *     "implementation".  The default ConnectionProperties for
 *     adapter <implementation> are fetched, and then overridden by
 *     the properties specified in the object.
 *
 * deployment is optional, and may be a string or a function.  In both cases
 * it refers to a function that can receive the ConnectionProperties obtained
 * using implName_or_connectionProperties and further modify them.
 *    - If it is unspecified or undefined, the ConnectionProperties object
 *      described above will be returned directly to the caller.
 *    - If it is a function, the function will be called with a single parameter
 *      holding a ConnectionProperties object.  The function may modify the
 *      object in place, or it may return a new object.  The new object or
 *      modified properties will be the return value of ConnectionProperties().
 *    - If it is a string, Jones will search for a jones_deployments.js file as
 *      described below.  The file will be expected to export a function whose
 *      name matches the string value.  If found, this function will be called
 *      with a single parameter as above.
 *
 *    jones_deployments.js seach path
 *    -------------------------------
 *    ConnectionProperties() searches for jones_deployments.js in the following
 *    directories:
 *       * The directory containing the currently executing main source file.
 *       * For each required() module in a chain from the main source file to
 *         jones.js, the directory containing that module.
 *       * The parent directory of the one containing the main source file,
 *         and then its parent, etc., up to the filesystem root.
 *       * The current working directory as stored in the CWD environment variable.
 *
 *  A sample jones_deployments.js file is provided.

/**
 * connect()

 * other nodes on the network, waiting for them to become ready, and making 
 * multiple requests to them. 
 *
 * This function returns a promise.  On success, the promise will be fulfilled 
 * with a SessionFactory.  The optional callback receives an error value and a 
 * SessionFactory.  Any extra arguments passed after the callback function will
 * be returned to the callback verbatim.
 *
 * The "implementation" member of the properties object determines the back end 
 * driver implementing the SessionFactory.
 *
 * The "constructorsOrTableNames" parameter can be used to preload metadata for application 
 * tables and to validate the defined mappings between stored data and 
 * JavaScript objects.  If constructorsOrTableNames contains a string table name, a Domain 
 * Object Constructor function, or an array of these, then metadata is loaded 
 * from the database and validated against the requirements of the mapping.
 * If constructorsOrTableNames is undefined, null, or an empty array, no mappings will be 
 * loaded or validated; this means validation is deferred until tables are 
 * used in application code.
