/*   
   Converters convert values between JavaScript types and database types.

   Converters can be defined for particular fields in a TableMapping,
   and can also be defined on the SessionFactory for all columns of a
   particular type.

   When a Converter is defined for a column, the converter's toDB() method is
   called before writing a value to the database, and the converter's fromDB()
   method is called after reading a value from the database.

   A Converter's fromDB() method receives a value of the JavaScript intermediate
   type for the type stored in the database.  Intermediate types should be
   JavaScript types that are able to store and retrieve values from a column
   without losing any data.

   Intermediate types are not standardized by Jones, but are defined by each
   DBServiceProvider.  Intermediate types for many database types are
   self-evident, such as JavaScript String for SQL VARCHAR and Node Buffer for
   SQL BINARY.

   Intermediate types for some other cases, such as 64-bit integer columns and
   some SQL temporal types, are less obvious.  Some 64-bit integer values are
   too big for JavaScript numbers, and some databases support time and date
   fields with range and precision that differ from standard JavaScript date.

   JavaScript Date supports millisecond precision, while MySQL can store
   times with microsecond precision. The jones-ndb DBServiceProvider uses a
   JavaScript class called MySQLTime as the intermediate type for DATE, TIME,
   and DATETIME columns, and defines type converters that translate between
   MySQLTime and JavaScript Date.  An application that required high precision
   time handling could use MySQLTime directly.

   Applications might also use converters to handle large numeric types with
   values that cannot be represented by a JavaScript Number.

   A converter object implements two functions: 
      toDB(obj)  : convert obj, an application object, 
                   into the intermediate type representation of a column
      fromDB(val): convert val, an intermediate type,
                   into an application object form
   Each function explicitly returns the result of the conversion.   
   
   A TypeConverter registered by the user takes precedence over the adapter's 
   default converter for a type (if any).
   
   A fieldConverter registered as part of a TableMapping takes precedence over 
   any typeConverters.
